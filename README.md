# Disaster Response Project

## Motivation
Due to climate change, the number of natural disasters has largely increased. 
During such emergency situation, disaster response organisations have the least capacity to filter out relevant messages. 

This project analyses thousands of real messages sent during natural disasters, either through social media or directly to disaster response organisations.

This project aims to help disaster response professionals filter out the relevant messages and classify the message category (e.g. water, medical supplies, food, etc.).
